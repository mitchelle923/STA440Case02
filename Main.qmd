## Introduction

## Methodology

```{r}
#indonesian gymnast's name is Abiyu RAFI not ABIYURAFI
laterdata <- laterdata |>
  mutate(FirstName = ifelse(LastName == "ABIYURAFI" & FirstName == ".", "Abiyu", FirstName),
    LastName = ifelse(LastName == "ABIYURAFI", "RAFI", LastName))


laterdata <- laterdata |>
  mutate(firstname_check = ifelse(str_length(FirstName) >= 3, 1, 0),
         lastname_check = ifelse(str_length(LastName) >= 3, 1, 0))

laterdata <- laterdata |>
  mutate(FirstName = ifelse(firstname_check == 0, paste0(FirstName, "_"), FirstName),
         LastName = ifelse(lastname_check == 0, paste0(LastName, "_"), LastName))

#based on string methods -- creating unique athlete IDs
laterdata <- laterdata |>
  mutate(unique_id = paste0(str_sub(FirstName, 1, 3), str_sub(LastName, 1, 3), "_", Country))

#create a vector for AA or team
AA_team <- c("AAfinal", "TeamFinal", "TeamQual", "AAqual")
'%notin%' <- function(x,y)!('%in%'(x,y))

finals_vector <- c("AAfinal", "TeamFinal", "final")
```


```{r}
#these quantiles are already grouped by gender and competition, round, apapratus, etc. so no bleeding
quantiled_data <- laterdata |>
  group_by(Gender, Competition, Round, Apparatus) |>
  mutate(quantile_20s = ntile(-Score, 5),
         quantile_10s = ntile(-Score, 10))

#filter out the athletes who have NEVER made it to a final, ever
filtered_data <- quantiled_data |>
  group_by(unique_id) |>
  filter(any(Round == "final" | Round == "TeamFinal" | Round == "AAfinal")) |>
  ungroup()

#summary of number of athletes competed in each competition in each round
number_athletes <- filtered_data |>
  group_by(Competition, Round) |>
  summarise(athletes_participated = n_distinct(unique_id))


# at the oceania continental championships, only 10 unique athletes competed
# every other competition at each round has at minimum 36 athletes competing
#at these final rounds, there are at least 40 athletes in each final, so it's fine
#going to left join to show the number of athletes that participated per round

joined_data <- filtered_data |>
  left_join(number_athletes, by = c("Competition", "Round"))

#now the athletes_participated column = how many athletes competed in it


#this filters out the individual records for ppl who were not in top quantiles at a competition
final_data <- joined_data |>
  filter((athletes_participated <= 100 & quantile_20s == 1) | (athletes_participated > 100 & quantile_10s == 1) | (Competition == "Oceania Continental Championships 2023" & quantile_20s %in% c(1, 2)))

#now let's check the number of unique athletes left
# final_data |>
#   group_by(Country) |>
#   summarise(athletes_left = n_distinct(unique_id))

#there are 679 athletes left in total once we have filtered, USA still has 91 left
```
